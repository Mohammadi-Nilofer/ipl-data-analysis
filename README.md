## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- How many matches were played each season?
- Total runs scored per season and per match?
- Which teams and players dominate various stats (wins, sixes, wickets, etc.)?
- Toss analysis: Does winning the toss impact match outcome?
- Which stadiums and venues are most favored?
- Performance in Powerplay (1–6 overs) vs. Death Overs (17–20 overs)

## 📊 Visualizations & Techniques Used

- Bar plots, line plots, pie charts, heatmaps using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Data wrangling and aggregation using `pandas`
- Match and player-level insights
- Comparative visual analytics (team-wise, season-wise)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 Key Insights

- Toss winners do not always win the match — varies by season
- Some teams have higher win rates at specific venues
- Certain players consistently dominate in boundaries and strike rates
- Teams scoring over 200+ runs are rare but influential
